# Heart Attack Prediction Project

##  Project Overview

This project applies the **Data Science Life Cycle** to predict the risk of heart attack based on patient health indicators. Using machine learning, we analyze clinical features (e.g., age, blood pressure, glucose, troponin levels) to classify patients into **positive (at risk)** or **negative (not at risk)** categories.

##  Data Source

* Dataset: **Heart Attack Clinical Dataset**
* Format: CSV file (`Heart Attack.csv`)
* Size: 1,319 patient records, 9 features (age, gender, pulse, blood pressure, glucose, kcm, troponin, class).
* Note: This dataset was obtained from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset/data .

## Workflow

The project follows the **full Data Science Life Cycle**:

1. **Data Collection**

   * The dataset was imported as a CSV file.

2. **Data Exploration**

   * Explored data using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.
   * Visualized distributions of age, gender, and heart attack labels using histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.
   * Checked correlations between features using a heatmap.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Renamed columns for clarity.
   * Handled outliers in the `impulse` column.
   * Checked for missing values.
   * Encoded the target variable (`class`) using LabelEncoder.

4. **Feature Engineering & Scaling**

   * Created a new feature `pulse_pressure = systolic_bp - diastolic_bp`.
   * Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.

5. **Model Building**

   * Split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
   * Applied **Logistic Regression** for classification.

6. **Model Evaluation**

   * Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score, macro average, weighted average).
   * Interpretation of metrics:

     * The model achieved **83% accuracy**.
     * Performs slightly better at predicting positive cases (patients at risk).
     * Macro average shows balanced performance across classes.
     * Weighted average accounts for class imbalance in the dataset.

**Results**

* Accuracy: 83%
* Negative Class: Precision = 0.77, Recall = 0.80, F1 = 0.78
* Positive Class: Precision = 0.87, Recall = 0.84, F1 = 0.86
* Macro Avg F1: 0.82 (balanced performance across classes)
* Weighted Avg F1: 0.83 (slightly favors Positive class, since dataset has more positive cases)

---

**Conclusions**

* The Logistic Regression model achieved good performance (83% accuracy).
* It performs better at predicting Positive (at risk) patients, which is critical in a medical setting since false negatives (missed risks) can be dangerous.
* There is still room for improvement:

  * Compare with other ML models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.)
  * Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
